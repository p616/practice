
Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Note that even though we want you to return the new length, make sure to change the original array as well in place

int removeDuplicates(vector<int> &A) 
{
    set<int> uniques;
    for (int n : A)
    {
        uniques.insert(n);
    }
    
    int pos = 0;
    for (auto it = uniques.begin(); it != uniques.end(); ++it)
    {
        A[pos++] = *it;
    }
    
    return uniques.size();
}
