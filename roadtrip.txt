 The tank capacity of this model is v liters, and it spends exactly 1 liter of fuel for 1 kilometer of the way. At the beginning of the journey, the tank is empty. Sasha is located in the city with the number 1 and wants to get to the city with the number n. There is a gas station in each city. In the i-th city, the price of 1 liter of fuel is i dollars. It is obvious that at any moment of time, the tank can contain at most v liters of fuel.
